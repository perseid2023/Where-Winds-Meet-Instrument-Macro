# Key Features Explained

**Clamp Notes**
What it does: Forces every note to stay within the 32-key range of the instrument.

When to use: Use this if your MIDI file has very high or very low notes that the game doesn't support. Instead of skipping those notes, the software will play the nearest available note at the edge of the keyboard.

**Octave Offset**
What it does: Shifts the entire song up or down in pitch.

Range: -3 to +3 octaves.

Why use it: If a song sounds too "squeaky" or too "deep," use the + or - hotkeys while playing to find the perfect pitch for your specific instrument.

**Playlist Toggles**
Loop: When the current song finishes, it starts over immediately.

Shuffle: Picks a random song from your list after the current one ends.

Auto-Next: When enabled, the player automatically moves to the next song in the list. If disabled, it will stop after one song.

# About

  ## What are MIDI?
   
   MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface, enables communication between electronic musical instruments, computers, and devices for music and sound production. It conveys note, timing, and control information, used to trigger sounds, control 
 synthesizers, and record performances. MIDI is a fundamental technology in the music industry.

  ## Can this get me banned?

   It's a bit uncertain, but I've personally used this tool on my own account for around a month, and so far, I haven't faced any bans. However, I'd advise you to exercise caution and use it at your own risk. Avoid playing songs that might flood your keyboard with 
 inputs. Make sure that you listen to the MIDI file beforehand, and consider sticking to a single instrument to prevent any keyboard spam."
