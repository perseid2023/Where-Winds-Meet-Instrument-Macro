# Where-Winds-Meet-Instrument-Macro

Python script that enables you to play all the songs on the Where Winds Meet.

# How to use


1. Download the zip folder that contains 'main.py' and extract it.
2. Download a MIDI music file that sounds good with the guitar, and then right-click on the downloaded MIDI file and select 'Copy as path'.
3. Open the extracted folder that contains 'main.py,' and right-click in the empty space to open Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell in that folder.
4. Open the game and go to the guitar screen.
5. Return to the Command/PowerShell window, enter the following commands, and switch back to the game after pressing Enter:
                   (You can change the speed based on midi or just run without --speed)
    ```
   py main.py "PATH" --speed 0.5  
     ```
6. Replace 'PATH' with the MIDI path you copied and ensure that you enclose the MIDI path with double quotation marks.

# About

  ## What are MIDI?
   
   MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface, enables communication between electronic musical instruments, computers, and devices for music and sound production. It conveys note, timing, and control information, used to trigger sounds, control 
 synthesizers, and record performances. MIDI is a fundamental technology in the music industry.

  ## Can this get me banned?

   It's a bit uncertain, but I've personally used this tool on my own account for around a month, and so far, I haven't faced any bans. However, I'd advise you to exercise caution and use it at your own risk. Avoid playing songs that might flood your keyboard with 
 inputs. Make sure that you listen to the MIDI file beforehand, and consider sticking to a single instrument to prevent any keyboard spam."
